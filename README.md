Sentiment Analysis is a term that you must have heard  if you have been in the Tech field long enough.  It is the process of predicting whether a piece of information  (i.e. text, most commonly) indicates a positive, negative or neutral sentiment  on the topic. In this project, I will go through making a Python program that  analyzes the sentiment of tweets on a particular topic. The user will be able  to input a keyword and get the sentiment on it based on the latest 100 tweets  that contain the input keyword.
